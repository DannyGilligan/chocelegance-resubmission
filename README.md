### Resolved Bugs

When trying to install Django AllAuth 0.41.0 I ran into the error message below<br>
"Python setup.py egg_info did not run successfully when installing"<br>
This was preventing me from installing the correct AllAuth package, after trying different approaches such as installing different versions of Django and Python, I found a post that suggested installing a specific version of 'Setuptools', I installed Setuptools version 67.4.0 which appears to have resolved the issue regarding the AllAuth installation
